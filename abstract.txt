composibility

realtime is just full duplex.
the original flow control.

Node already has lots of abtractions for handling full duplex streams.
Let's just use those.

What should we look for in abstractions to handle streams?

* shoe
* mux-demux
* pipe-able dnode
* emit-stream
* through
* JSONStream
* pause-stream
* concat-stream

and all of these just work with browserify so you can use the same streaming
abstractions browser-side

http streams too!
* dnode over http
